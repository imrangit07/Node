What are Models in Node.js?
Models are a core component in backend development (especially in MVC architecture) that:

Represent data structures (e.g., users, products, orders)

Define business logic (data validation, calculations)

Interact with databases (fetching, updating, deleting records)

Key Responsibilities of Models
Data Structure – Define how data is organized (e.g., a User model has name, email, password).

Database Operations – Handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Validation – Ensure data correctness (e.g., email format, password strength).

Relationships – Define how models interact (e.g., a Post belongs to a User).



Why Use Models in Node.js?
✅ Separation of Concerns – Keeps database logic separate from routes/controllers.
✅ Reusability – The same model can be used across multiple routes.
✅ Consistency – Ensures data follows predefined rules (e.g., required fields).
✅ Security – Sanitizes inputs to prevent SQL injection or invalid data.

Types of Models
1. Database Models (ORM/ODM)
Used with libraries like:

Mongoose (for MongoDB)

Sequelize (for SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Prisma (modern ORM for TypeScript/Node.js)




// models/User.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

// Export the model
module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
