Definition
Routes in Node.js define how an application responds to client requests to particular endpoints (URIs) and specific HTTP request methods (GET, POST, etc.). They are the pathways that determine what code executes when a particular URL is accessed with a specific HTTP method.

Why We Use Routes
Organization: Routes help structure your application by separating different functionalities

Maintainability: Makes code easier to understand and modify

Scalability: Allows for adding new endpoints without disrupting existing ones

RESTful API Design: Essential for creating RESTful services

Request Handling: Determines how different types of requests are processed

What You Need
To work with routes in Node.js, you typically need:

A Node.js server (using built-in http module or frameworks like Express)

A router (either built manually or using Express's router)

Request handlers (functions that process requests)




Basic Example (using Express)

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Define routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home Page');
});

app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About Page');
});

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  // Handle login logic
  res.send('Login Successful');
});

// Route with parameters
app.get('/users/:userId', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User ID: ${req.params.userId}`);
});

// Start server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
