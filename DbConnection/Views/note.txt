What are Views in Node.js?
Views (or templates) are dynamic HTML pages that render data from your Node.js server before sending them to the client. They allow you to:

Generate dynamic content (e.g., user profiles, product listings)

Reuse layouts (headers, footers)

Inject server-side data into HTML
